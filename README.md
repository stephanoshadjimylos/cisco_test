Hello, thank you for taking the time to go through my code!

If you choose to use a virtual environment (recommended), a popular one for python is virtualenv.
To do this, follow these steps:
1. pip install virtualenv
2. python -m venv .
3. Scripts/activate
You are now in your virtual environment

Run this code using the following steps:

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. from the root directory type: python mac_address_api.py
3. enter the desired MAC Address
